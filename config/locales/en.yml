      The main purpose of this section of Hacking Chinese is to provide links to interesting resources for Chinese learners. Note that even though it works well for sharing the latest news, **the primary goal is to create an archive of resources for learners of Chinese**. This is what makes this section of the site very different from Reddit and other similar communities that are more focused on the present and only offer limited search possibilities. Therefore, **it's very important that you tag all links properly and also write about why you are sharing them**, preferably by summarising what it is about and why it's good. People shouldn't have to go to the site in order to figure out if it's for them or not. **The first two questions below have to be answered properly for every link that it posted to the site**.

      #### Question #1: What proficiency level is this link relevant for?

      If you search for listening material, you don't want to find ten interesting programs that are all too difficult, or if you are an advanced learner, you don't want to find five grammar resources that deal with very basic concepts you're already familiar with. **Therefore, sorting a link according to whom it's relevant for is absolutely essential**.

      The answer is given using three tags: [beginner](http://www.hackingchinese.com/archive-2/beginner/), [intermediate](http://www.hackingchinese.com/archive-2/intermediate/) and [advanced](http://www.hackingchinese.com/archive-2/advanced/) (click the links for closer definitions; they are the same as those I use elsewhere on Hacking Chinese). Note that resources can have more than one tag detailing proficiency. A chengyu story can be useful for both intermediate and advanced students, for instance, or an article in English about cultural pitfalls can target all learners.

      #### Question #2: What skill areas does the link target?

      Many casual or frequent visitors might skip this question altogether, but it's essential for the archive function of the site. If a visitor wants to find resources for improving a certain skill, they should be able to find that easily. The answer is given using the four primary skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing. Since this is fairly crude, I have decided to add vocabulary, grammar, culture and how-to-learn to the list.

      There can be overlap when answering this question as well. For instance, a site that offers both reading and listening exercises should be tagged with both tags. An article in English about how to improve listening ability should be tagged with how-to-learn and listening. However, **tag links according to the main focus of the resource**; just because there are subtitles in a video doesn't make it reading practice.

      #### Question #3: What is the link about?

      Even though answering this third question is optional, you should **do your best to describe the link further using the available tags**. For instance, it might be interesting to know what kind of medium is being shared (blog-post/video/audio/app) or if the resource is behind the Great Firewall or a normal pay wall. Remember, the goal isn't only to make it clear what the link is about to those who see it now, it's also to allow people who search through the links to find what they're looking for. At the moment, you can't create new tags, but please suggest new tags that should be created, [please add them to this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cgi_AuO97FZJicRXq9wRp742sNpvW_xPmHY_Rpy0v7k/edit?usp=sharing) or send a message to Olle.
